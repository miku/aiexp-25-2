### Chat with your documents (PDF)

> Exploring a set of 22K docs and 500K pages with the help of AI

What can the machine learn from this corpus?

* let's cluster it into 2, 3, ..., 10 categories, what do we get?
* let's embed the documents into a vector database and see which records are similar
* let's embed paragraphs and see which documents are similar

Matching queries against documents.

* full text search
* natural language query; LLM and RAG
* natural language query to document query; fuzzy text, but exact query
* query in images

You can do this with any document set.

### MCP server for catalogs

* expose a library catalog to a chat interface
* make it so that we can find books, text, new items, but also images, digitized pages, and more
